I work on projects to solidify my understanding and improve my coding skills.  Please feel free to borrow my codes or give me any feedback. 

Number Guessing Game:
Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
Check user's guess against actual answer.
Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).
