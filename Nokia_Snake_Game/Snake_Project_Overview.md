This is a replicate of the Nokia Snake Game.

A scoreboard is shown on the top of the screen to keep track of the scores

Here are the rules:

1 A food is randomly generated in the screen

2 Once the snake touches the food, the food will regenerate in another random place in the screen and the score increase by 1

3 If the snake touches the wall, game over

4 If the snake's head touches its body, game over

5 Every time the snake eats food, its body length increases by one

6 The snake can move up, down, left, or right. When the snake moves up, it can not change direction to down. Vice versa. The same concept applies to left/right.
