# Projects
I work on projects to solidify my understanding and improve my coding skills.  Please feel free to borrow my codes or give me any feedback.

We have a list of dictionaries with information on the top 50 Instagram accounts with the most followers.

I wrote a program to select 2 random accounts: Account A & Account B, print out the information and ask the user to guess which account has more followers.

If the guess is right, the user gets 1 point and a new round of the game starts. The Account B from the last round now becomes Account A in this round and
we select a new random account B. 

If the guess is wrong, the game ends.
