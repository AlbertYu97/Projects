# About
This is a Flashcard designed for learning vocabulary in a foreign language. A random foreign word shows up a time, the English translation shows up 3 seconds later. If the user clicks the check button, it means the user knows the meaning of the word and the word would be taken out of the list (The word will not show up again in the future).
