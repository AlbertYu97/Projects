# About 
This is a timer to help me to focus on study. A study session starts once the 'Start' button is clicked. Each mini-study session is 25 min, followed by a 5 min break.
A check mark will be displayed on the screen once each mini-study session is completed. A single study consists of four 25-minutes study sessions, three 5-minutes break  and one 20-minutes break.
