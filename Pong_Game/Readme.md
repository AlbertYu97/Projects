# Pong Game

Pong is one of the first computer games that was ever created, this simple "tennis-like" game features two paddles and a ball, 
a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

## Features

I used OOP to tackle the Pong Game. I created 3 classes and finished the game in 7 mini steps.
- Create the screen
- Create the paddle class
- Create the ball class and make it move
- Detect the collsion with wall(top/bottom of the screen) and bounce
- Detect the collision with paddle
- Detect when paddle misses(score) and reset the ball to starting position
- Create the scoreboard class and keep score for 2 players
